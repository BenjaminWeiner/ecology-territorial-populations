Code and data for the article, "Spatial Ecology of Territorial Populations" (https://doi.org/10.1101/694257).

Each figure from the article has its own folder, and all the plots from that figure can be generated by evaluating the corresponding  Mathematica notebooks. When a notebook is analyzing data from a larger simulation, both the data and the code to generate it are included in the "data" subfolder. 

The folder "minimal example code" contains simple implementations of the models from the article, with more thorough explanatory comments.

Any uses or extensions of this code should cite the article:
